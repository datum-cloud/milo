## OrganizationMembership
<sup><sup>[↩ Parent](#resourcemanagermiloapiscomv1alpha1 )</sup></sup>






OrganizationMembership establishes a user's membership in an organization and
optionally assigns roles to grant permissions. The controller automatically
manages PolicyBinding resources for each assigned role, simplifying access
control management.

Key features:
  - Establishes user-organization relationship
  - Automatic PolicyBinding creation and deletion for assigned roles
  - Supports multiple roles per membership
  - Cross-namespace role references
  - Detailed status tracking with per-role reconciliation state

Prerequisites:
  - User resource must exist
  - Organization resource must exist
  - Referenced Role resources must exist in their respective namespaces

Example - Basic membership with role assignment:

	apiVersion: resourcemanager.miloapis.com/v1alpha1
	kind: OrganizationMembership
	metadata:
	  name: jane-acme-membership
	  namespace: organization-acme-corp
	spec:
	  organizationRef:
	    name: acme-corp
	  userRef:
	    name: jane-doe
	  roles:
	  - name: organization-viewer
	    namespace: organization-acme-corp

Related resources:
  - User: The user being granted membership
  - Organization: The organization the user joins
  - Role: Defines permissions granted to the user
  - PolicyBinding: Automatically created by the controller for each role

### OrganizationMembership.spec

          Roles specifies a list of roles to assign to the user within the organization.
The controller automatically creates and manages PolicyBinding resources for
each role. Roles can be added or removed after the membership is created.

Optional field. When omitted or empty, the membership is established without
any role assignments. Roles can be added later via update operations.

Each role reference must specify:
  - name: The role name (required)
  - namespace: The role namespace (optional, defaults to membership namespace)

Duplicate roles are prevented by admission webhook validation.

Example:

  roles:
  - name: organization-admin
    namespace: organization-acme-corp
  - name: billing-manager
    namespace: organization-acme-corp
  - name: shared-developer

### OrganizationMembership.status
<sup><sup>[↩ Parent](#organizationmembership)</sup></sup>



OrganizationMembershipStatus defines the observed state of OrganizationMembership.
The controller populates this status to reflect the current reconciliation state,
including whether the membership is ready and which roles have been successfully applied.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>

        <td>[]object</td>
        <td>
          AppliedRoles tracks the reconciliation state of each role in spec.roles.
This array provides per-role status, making it easy to identify which
roles are applied and which failed.

Each entry includes:
  - name and namespace: Identifies the role
  - status: "Applied", "Pending", or "Failed"
  - policyBindingRef: Reference to the created PolicyBinding (when Applied)
  - appliedAt: Timestamp when role was applied (when Applied)
  - message: Error details (when Failed)

Use this to troubleshoot role assignment issues. Roles marked as "Failed"
include a message explaining why the PolicyBinding could not be created.

Example:

  appliedRoles:
  - name: org-admin
    namespace: organization-acme-corp
    status: Applied
    appliedAt: "2025-10-28T10:00:00Z"
    policyBindingRef:
      name: jane-acme-membership-a1b2c3d4

          Conditions represent the current status of the membership.

Standard conditions:
  - Ready: Indicates membership has been established (user and org exist)
  - RolesApplied: Indicates whether all roles have been successfully applied

Check the RolesApplied condition to determine overall role assignment status:
  - True with reason "AllRolesApplied": All roles successfully applied
  - True with reason "NoRolesSpecified": No roles in spec, membership only
  - False with reason "PartialRolesApplied": Some roles failed (check appliedRoles for details)<br/>

### OrganizationMembership.status.appliedRoles[index]
<sup><sup>[↩ Parent](#organizationmembershipstatus)</sup></sup>



AppliedRole tracks the reconciliation status of a single role assignment
within an organization membership. The controller maintains this status to
