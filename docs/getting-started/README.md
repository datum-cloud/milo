# Getting Started with Milo

Welcome to Milo, an extensible business operating system designed for
product-led B2B companies and service providers.

## What is Milo?

Milo is a foundational platform that provides the essential systems of record
every B2B service provider needs to scale efficiently. Instead of building or
stitching together dozens of disparate back-office tools, Milo delivers a
unified, API-driven control plane for managing your business operations.

## Who Milo is For

- **Infrastructure & Cloud Providers**: Companies like bare metal hosts, edge
  computing providers, and specialized infrastructure services that need to gain
  the same operational advantages that traditional hyperscalers have built over
  decades - sophisticated consumer management, automated resource provisioning,
  and enterprise-grade compliance capabilities.

- **Alternative Cloud Providers**: Next-generation cloud companies building
  specialized infrastructure services who need enterprise-grade business
  operations without the complexity and cost of building custom back-office
  systems from scratch.

- **Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms**: Software companies serving business consumers
  who require sophisticated organization hierarchies, granular access controls,
  usage-based billing, and compliance reporting across diverse customer segments
  and enterprise requirements.

## Core Functional Areas

- **Resource Management**: Lifecycle management for services and resources that
  service providers offer to their consumers, typically organized by projects.

- **Identity & Access Management**: User and machine authentication,
  authorization, and role-based access control system that scales from
  individual users to enterprise hierarchies.

- **Quota & Entitlement Management**: Dynamic usage limits, feature access
  controls, and customer tiering that enables sophisticated business models from
  freemium to enterprise.

- **Audit & Telemetry Management**: Audit trails and operational observability
  designed for compliance, business intelligence, and AI-driven insights.

- **Vendor & Partner Management**: Sophisticated third-party relationship
  management that supports complex business ecosystems where interconnected
  networks of vendors, partners, and sub-processors require automated workflow
  management and compliance tracking.

- **Contact & Customer Management**: Advanced customer data platform with
  dynamic segmentation, lifecycle management, and integrated communication
  workflows that goes beyond traditional CRM.

## Key Benefits

- **Build on a Community-Driven Foundation**: Help establish an open-source
  ecosystem where service providers collaborate on shared business operating
  system challenges rather than each company rebuilding the same back-office
  tools independently.

- **Eliminate Data Silos**: Break down barriers between customer management,
  billing, compliance, and operations with unified data models and event-driven
  architecture that keeps all systems synchronized in real-time.

- **Future-Proof Your Business Operations**: Avoid vendor lock-in and adapt to
  changing business needs with extensible provider integrations and declarative
  configuration that evolves with your organization without architectural
  rewrites.

## How Milo Works

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on an event-driven foundation, Milo
  enables real-time reactions to business events across all functional areas.
  This event-driven approach ensures consistency, enables automation, and
  provides the foundation for building intelligent, responsive business
  operations.

- **Extensible Provider Framework**: Rather than building everything from
  scratch, Milo's provider architecture enables seamless integration with
  specialized best-in-class services for authentication, billing, fraud
  detection, support, and more. This extensible approach lets you choose the
  right tools for each domain while maintaining a unified control plane and
  consistent data model across your entire business operation.

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Designed from the ground up for multi-tenancy,
  Milo enables service providers to scale from single consumers to enterprise
  organizations while maintaining isolation, performance, and security. The
  architecture supports complex organizational hierarchies and can adapt to
  diverse business models without architectural changes.

## Integration Ecosystem

Milo's real-time event-driven architecture is designed to support seamless
integrations with third-party services and tools to meet your businesses needs.
Milo's integration ecosystem is designed to be extensible and modular, allowing
service providers to choose the best tools for their business. We expect to have
integrations covering tools in the following areas (but not limited to):

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Enterprise SSO, fine-grained permissions
- **Billing & Metering**: Usage tracking, invoice generation, payment processing
- **Support & CRM**: Customer service, ticketing, relationship management
- **Fraud Detection**: User verification, risk analysis, compliance monitoring
- **Business Intelligence**: Analytics, reporting, predictive insights
- **Communication**: Email, notifications, marketing automation

Integrators can build custom integrations that respond to business events (e.g.
consumer sign ups, resource provisioning, etc) through real-time event streams.
