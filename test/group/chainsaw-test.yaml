    Tests IAM Group functionality including creation, membership, and garbage collection.

    This test verifies:
    - Groups can be created and become Ready
    - PolicyBindings can reference groups
    - GroupMemberships link users to groups
    - Deleting a group cascades to delete GroupMemberships
    - PolicyBindings are updated when groups are deleted
    - PolicyBindings are deleted when they have no remaining subjects
