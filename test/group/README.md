# Test: `group`

Tests IAM Group functionality including creation, membership, and garbage collection.

This test verifies:
- Groups can be created and become Ready
- PolicyBindings can reference groups
- GroupMemberships link users to groups
- Deleting a group cascades to delete GroupMemberships
- PolicyBindings are updated when groups are deleted
- PolicyBindings are deleted when they have no remaining subjects
