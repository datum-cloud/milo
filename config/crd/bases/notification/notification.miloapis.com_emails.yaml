          Email is the Schema for the emails API.
          It represents a concrete e-mail that should be sent to the referenced users.
          For idempotency purposes, controllers can use metadata.uid as a unique identifier
          to prevent duplicate email delivery, since it's guaranteed to be unique per resource instance.
