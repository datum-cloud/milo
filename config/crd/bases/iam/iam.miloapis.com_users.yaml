          Users are cluster-scoped\nresources that exist globally across the entire
          Milo deployment and serve as the foundation\nfor identity and access management.\n\nUsers
          are automatically created when a person authenticates or registers with
          the Milo\nplatform for the first time, though they can also be created manually
          by administrators.\nEach user is uniquely identified by their email address
          and integrates with external\nidentity providers for authentication.\n\nKey
          characteristics:\n- Cluster-scoped: Users exist globally and can be referenced
          from any namespace\n- Email-based identity: Each user is uniquely identified
          by their email address\n- Automatic lifecycle: Created during first authentication/registration\n-
          Cross-namespace access: Can be granted permissions across different projects/namespaces\n\nCommon
          usage patterns:\n- New user onboarding when team members join\n- Permission
          management through groups or direct role bindings\n- Audit trails for tracking
          user activities across the system\n- Identity foundation for all IAM operations\n\nExample:\n\n\tapiVersion:

              UserSpec defines the desired state of User, containing the core identity information

                  Email is the unique email address that identifies this user in the system.
                  This field is required and serves as the primary identifier for the user.
                  The email must be unique across all users in the cluster.

                  FamilyName is the user's last name or family name. This field is optional
                  and is used for display purposes and user identification in UI contexts.

              givenName:
                description: |-
                  GivenName is the user's first name or given name. This field is optional

              UserStatus defines the observed state of User, indicating the current status

                  Conditions provide detailed status information about the User resource.
                  The primary condition type is "Ready" which indicates whether the user
                  has been successfully synchronized with the authentication provider and
                  is ready for use in the IAM system.

                  Common condition types:
                  - Ready: Indicates the user is properly synchronized and available
                  - Synced: Indicates successful synchronization with external auth provider

                  Example condition:
                    - type: Ready
                      status: "True"
                      reason: UserReady
