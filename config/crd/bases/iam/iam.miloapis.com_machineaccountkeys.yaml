                  PrivateKey contains the private key material returned by the auth provider, base64-encoded
                  for safe transport in JSON. The actual content and format depend on the auth provider
                  implementation—some providers return raw key material, others include metadata or structured
                  payloads.

                  The controller sets this value only once, immediately after key creation. Callers MUST
                  download and persist it securely because it will be wiped from the status during the
                  next reconciliation cycle to avoid persisting sensitive data in the cluster.

                  Example (Zitadel decoded key material):
                  {
                    "type": "serviceaccount",
