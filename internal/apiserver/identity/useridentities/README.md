Virtual UserIdentities API (identity.miloapis.com/v1alpha1)

This package implements Milo's public, virtual UserIdentities API. It exposes
identity.miloapis.com/v1alpha1, Resource=useridentities without persisting anything
to etcd. All operations are delegated to a provider API so RBAC and audit
reflect the end-user.

Components and flow
- StorageProvider (internal/apiserver/storage/identity/storageprovider.go)
  - Installs API group identity.miloapis.com/v1alpha1 and wires the useridentities
    resource to the REST storage.
- REST storage (this package, rest.go)
  - Implements List/Get for a cluster-scoped virtual resource.
  - Extracts the request user from context and delegates to a Provider.
  - Implements Table output so kubectl get useridentities.identity.miloapis.com
    works without -o json.
- Provider (this package, dynamic.go)
  - DynamicProvider uses a dynamic client with impersonation to call a
    provider GVR (configured via flags) and converts unstructured ↔ typed
    identity/v1alpha1 objects.
  - Strict pass-through: Milo does not mutate or default provider fields.

Configuration
- Enable the feature and point to a provider GVR via flags on the apiserver:
  - --feature-useridentities=true
  - --useridentities-provider-url=https://identity.miloapis.com
  - --useridentities-provider-ca-file=
  - --useridentities-provider-client-cert=
  - --useridentities-provider-client-key=
  - Optional: --provider-timeout, --provider-retries,
    --forward-extras=org,tenant
- At startup Milo builds a GroupVersionResource from the flags and uses it in
  DynamicProvider for all requests.


Naming & structure
- internal/apiserver/storage/identity/storageprovider.go — group installer
- internal/apiserver/identity/useridentities/rest.go — REST storage
- internal/apiserver/identity/useridentities/dynamic.go — provider implementation

Read-only resource and admission webhook for deletion
Unlike sessions, useridentities is a read-only resource. Users cannot create,
update, or delete user identities through the Kubernetes API. Identity linking
and unlinking is managed through the external identity provider (e.g., Zitadel).

If a user attempts to delete a UserIdentity via the Kubernetes API, the operation will be explicitly rejected by an admission webhook, which returns an error similar to:

    deleting UserIdentity resources is not currently supported. Identity provider links must be managed through the authentication provider (e.g., Zitadel). Automatic email synchronization logic is required before deletion can be enabled

This error response ensures deletions are consistently blocked at the API layer, clarifying current support and intended usage.
